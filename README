CONTENTS
    make.py -- module for making data. Contains generation parameters and data-
    making functions.
            
            transition_matrix = make.transitions()
            emission_matrix = make.emissions()
            correct_states = make.states(transition_matrix)
            values = make.values(correct_states, emission_matrix)
            
    train.py -- module with 3 main HMM algorithms: EM, Viterbi and forward-back-
    ward.
                
            # HMM is a tuple, (transition_matrix, emission_matrix)
            hmm = train.hmm(values)
            states = train.states_viterbi(values, hmm[0], hmm[1])
            
    check.py -- module for checking quality of resulting segmentation.
        
            precision = check.segments_precision(correct_states, states)
            recall = check.segments_recall(correct_states, states)
            
    visualisze.py -- module for visualization of transitions/emission probabili-
    ties and resulting segmentations. 
            
            # Open new tabs in browser with table of emission probabilities and 
            # pictures of transition graph and segmentation quality.
            visualize.transitions(transition_matrix)
            visualize.emissions(emission_matrix)
            visualize.segmentation(correct_values, values)
